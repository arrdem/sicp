# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

I read this book as sophomore in college and it had a huge impact for
me. Suddenly a lot of the pieces clicked into place. It's been a
couple years now and my SICP copy is battered from being passed around
to various friends but it feels like now's a good time to re-visit
this text as I'm dusting off some other old reading.

This repo is my worked solutions to the exercises in SICP, and maybe
notes on the re-read. We'll see.
